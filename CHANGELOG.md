## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added

- `memory docs` writes a Nessa Docs atlas under `docs/state` with no model and no network (#14).
- Auto propose and tidy on personal git hooks and long sessions, plus a loop breaker after three identical command failures (#15).
- Untracked rules blocks with one tracked `AGENTS.md` pointer line so clones stay usable without cairnkit (#15).
- `memory docs --check` reports drifted `docs/state` pages without writing; `verify.sh` runs it (#17).
- Post-merge prints one line when the atlas is stale so you can run `memory docs --force` (#17).

### Changed

- Non-rule fact body cap is 2000 characters with an optional `summary`; rules stay at 400 (#15).
- Session and git hooks stay silent when `memory init` was never run (#15).
- Identity check accepts owner GitHub squash merges titled `(#N)` (#15).
